    * Software developers tend to understand bluetooth as a digital thing.
    * Because it is used from a digital environment, like so many other things.
    *
    * But this is a radio.
    *
    * This means for example that our mentality when writing code should
    * be from a radio perspective and not from a computer perspective.
    * What does this change? Well, for example you need to remember that
    * a radio can either receive or send transmissions but cannot do both
    * at the same time. Also, remember that listening is preferable on a
    * radio than just transmitting without stopping.
    *
    * When you keep these advices in mind, then programming features on top
    * of bluetooth becomes far easier and actually works as expected.
